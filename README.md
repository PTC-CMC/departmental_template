## VU Departmental Latex Template

A basic latex template primarily designed for Departmental Exams at
VU, though this is a general enough template for most papers.

### Installing Latex
Before compiling your document, a Latex distribution should be
installed.  See link for distributions for all OS: https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions

### Instructions
- Figures should be kept in the `img` directory
- The tex files are contained in the `tex` directory and are separated
  by section
- bibtex entries are contained in `library.bib`.  The easiest way to
  generate this file is through Mendeley.
- To generate your document, simply run `bash compile.sh` on the
  command line.
