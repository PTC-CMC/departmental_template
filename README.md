## VU Departmental Latex Template

A basic latex template primarily designed for Departmental Exams at
VU, though this is a general enough template for most papers.

### Instructions
- Figure files go in the `img` directory
- The tex files are contained in the `tex` directory and are separated
  by section
- bibtex entries are contained in `library.bib`.  The easiest way to
  generate this file is through Mendeley.
- To generate your document, simply run `bash compile.sh` on the
  command line.
